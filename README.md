# Delete Bot
 Python discord bot

This bot is a solution to a problem I have had with Discord. I developed an easy, streamlined way to delete messages based on keywords. My original issue was that I didn't want my younger siblings to see me swear in the Discord chat when I invited them to join. I had no idea whether this idea or bot exists otherwise, but the premise is new.

I also used this project to develop my Python skills, and I have wanted to develop a bot for a while now.

<h2> Key Takeaways</h2>
- I learned to optimise search algorithms in Python
- Further developed my to read, search and understand documentation and write my own comments regarding the code
- Furthered my knowledge of Python syntax and features. (I missed C++ at some stages)
